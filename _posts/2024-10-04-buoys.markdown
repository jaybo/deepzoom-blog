### NDBC Buoys

[NDBC Buoys](https://www.ndbc.noaa.gov/) provide real time measurements of wind speed, water and air temperature, barometric pressure, and wave height.

DeepZoom now displays these on a separate layer which can be enabled or disabled on the Layers dialog. Data is automatically refreshed every 5 minutes.


#### Other new features

- You can now use the search dialog to find tide and current stations.


#### Bug Fixes

- Creating routes on touch devices has long been a bit flakey, with accidental double taps ending the route creation prematurely.
I've been trying to work around this bug in the Mapbox drawing component for years now and the problem seems to be finally fixed!
The gory details are [here](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-draw/issues/1212). 

- The Celsius selection on the Settings tab now actually does something.

- DeepZoom would sometimes forget that you were logged in after a browser refresh.

- If startup fails, prompt user to initiate refresh.

- Trips saved with the Public option sometimes would not appear when searching using "Find Trips in this Area".
