DeepZoom works worldwide for trip planning.  Here's an example of transiting the Cape Cod Canal 
when the current is flowing at peak velocity.

When you save a trip in DeepZoom it resides in the cloud.  You can specify whether it can be viewed by the general public
or only by persons with whom you share a link.

In either case, just copy the link and share it with anyone you want:
