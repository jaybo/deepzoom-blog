### New features

This is mostly a fit and finish release.  Lot's of UI and perf improvements plus a new display of relative positions of earth, sun and moon.  This animation, like everything else in DeepZoom is 
linked to the timebase.  The timebase is accessed by clicking on the time readout at the lower center of the screen.
