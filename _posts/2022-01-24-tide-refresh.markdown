### Tide and current data refresh 

All of the USA tides and currents are now updated to the latest NOAA 2022 data release.
Tide and current data is available between the dates of 2014.01.01 through 2029.12.31 inclusive.

For the first time in DeepZoom, this includes coverage for currents in Chesapeake Bay, Delaware Bay, and many locations in New England.

Thanks, as always to David Flater  [(xtide)](https://flaterco.com/xtide/files.html) for collecting and publishing the .tcd files which I use to generate the millions 
tide fragment files which enables DeepZoom's rapid display. 


I would be delighted to extend DeepZoom tide and current coverage throughout the world.  <br/>
If you know of any public domain harmonic sources please let me know!
