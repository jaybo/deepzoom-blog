## Version 3 is out!

Whew! Halt! Enough already! I surrender!

Version 3 is a culmination of the work over the winter.  Learning WebGL.  Retinking some of the UI.  Weather display is pretty much a complete redo.

## UI updates

Until this release, a lot of the important functionality in DeepZoom hasn't been, er, easily discoverable. It's there, but often buried a bit too deep.
For example, switching between layers required dragging multiple opacity sliders back and forth. Now, all gone! Instead, just click on a button
to show/hide charts, tides and currents, and pilot charts.

#### Quick access to route creation

Based on my own subjective usage, creating and editing routes and markers, and then starting over need to be easily accessible. 

Now they are.

#### Toggle charts, tides and currents, and pilot charts

Any or all of these can be simultaneously active.  The orange circle indicates the layer is active.

You can still control opacity of each layer separately  using the sliders in the layers dialog.

## Weather

Weather display got a total makeover with plenty of cudos going to
<a href="https://www.windy.com" target="_blank"> Windy</a> and
<a href="https://www.ventusky.com" target="_blank"> Ventusky</a> for inspiration.
Notice that precipitation, temperature, and wind velocity and direction are all updated simultaneously and synchronous to whatever location is displayed in the exact
center of the screen.

Toggle a weather layer on or off with these buttons.  Notice you have to click the circular part of the readout to toggle.

Precipitation, temperature, and wind overlay and obsure most everything in layers below.  But you can set a zoom level beyond which the weather layer is hidden.

#### Hide the weather based on zoom

These controls are on the settings page.

If you want to hide the streamers completely, just move the bottom slider to the far left.

### Weather resolution

DeepZoom club members can choose the resolution of weather data displayed.  The free version includes 1°x1° resolution data. 
DeepZoom club members can choose either 0.5°x0.5° (4x data) or 0.25°x0.25° (16x data) as well as time resoution of either 1 or 3 hours.
If you don't have great bandwidth, performance will be smoother with lower resolution settings.


## Goodbye 3D

Rotation and tilt of the map have been features since V2. These, along with 3D terrain views made nice eye candy, but probably weren't that functional for most users.  
3D also increases DeepZoom's memory footprint and CPU/GPU/bandwidth usage.
And, 3D never quite worked perfectly as you may have noticed if you ever tried editing a route while in 3D mode. At random moments, the draw code would crash in a way that I couldn't work around.
While this could have been due to issues in my code, I'm pretty sure there's a problem inside of mapbox and mapbox-draw, specifically
<a href="https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-js/issues/10927" target="_blank"> https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-js/issues/10927</a> and 
<a href="https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-draw/issues/1077" target="_blank"> https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-draw/issues/1077</a>

So, I've made the somewhat painful decision to disable 3D, tilt, and rotation until these issues are resolved. All of this code is still in the codebase, but is just dormant.
All existing scripts continue to function, but any 3D operation is quietly ignored.  

I'm curious how many users will actually miss the 3D views.  Take a poll here:

## Scripting

Scripting has a few new features. I've long wanted to put a real programming language inside of DeepZoom, but sharing trips which contain executable javascript is a security risk.
So as a stopgap measure, I've added a simple javascript phrase parser which allows conditional execution of script events.  The `if` conditional is; 

```
"if": <condition is true>
```

I've begun exposing internal DeepZoom variables which can be used in the conditional phrase:  `loopCount`, `isPlaying`, `isDragging`, and `sliderPosition`.  `LoopCount` is incremented once each pass through a trip, so to toggle the wind layer on and off every other pass through a trip playback
the syntax is:

```
{ "weather":"wind-wind", "if": "loopCount % 2 == 0" }  // if loopCount is even
{ "weather":"off", "if": "loopCount % 2 == 1" }  // if loopCount is odd
```

"%"  is a remainder operation in javascript, so the top line reads "if the remainder of loopCount / 2 is zero".

### Bug fixes

1. Lots.
