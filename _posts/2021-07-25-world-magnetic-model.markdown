### New features

1. You can now show the following for each leg of a route:
  - route leg length
  - Magnetic compass heading
  - True compass heading


  Each of these can be enabled/disabled individually (see the settings page).  The magnetic course value is derived from the World Magnetic Model (currently WMM2020, valid from 2020-2025).
