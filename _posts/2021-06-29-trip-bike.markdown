DeepZoom was designed for trips on the water.  But you can also use it for
driving, hiking, and biking trips.

Here's an example of a multi-modal trip, biking from Blaine, WA through the 
San Juan Islands.  Each terrestrial leg is a separate route, and each ferry ride is a separate route.

{: .notice--warning}

To create terrestrial routes, first define start, end, and waypoints as you normally would with 
aquatic trips.  Then on the routes page, change the mode of transit (driving, walking, biking),
and your route will be converted to the new mode.

If you need to change the route, the easiest way is just to convert back to the original "great circle" or 
ship/plane navigation mode, add or change waypoints, and then convert back to driving, walking, or biking.
