## Rich Media
I'm a daily user of Wikipedia and Twitter.  And 
I've long imagined adapting the spirit of these innovations into DeepZoom, creating an authoritative information source for trips and markers (the Wikipedia part) along with user contributions including comments, images, videos, and ratings (the Twitter part).

This release marks the introduction of both of these features.

To some extent, these features overlap those offered by [https://activecaptain.com](https://activecaptain.com) and [https://marinas.com](https://marinas.com).  So rather than focusing on the ever changing details of which marinas have ice, or total number of berths, the intent is just to provide a link to the authoritative source at the top of each marker description.

But what is unique here is that each marker and trip can optionally include a series of comments with images and video.  The user interaction model is similar to Twitter, and you can comment on others comments.


Anyone who has tried to spelunk through Amazon product reviews for valid information knows that the tragedy of the commons applies to the internet.  Mindless and irrelevant comments and reviews seem to be the norm, and bots seem to be taking over.
To try and limit such flotsam and jetsam on DeepZoom, only subscribers can post new content or add ratings.

### The content editor

The editor is divided into three sections: text, images, videos.  Each section is optional.  
Both images and videos can be drag and dropped onto the editing page. Images retain their full original resolution. At this time, videos must be hosted on YouTube.
