### Undo / Redo (Finally!)

<img src="/assets/images/undo.png"  width="100%" />

Any operation which alters geometries is automatically saved in an undo stack.
This includes adding, moving, and deleting markers or routes, as well as reversing routes or trips.
The entire state of the trip (routes, markers, and scripts) as of that moment is saved as a snapshot. 
The size of the undo and redo stacks is not limited.
Any new geometry change resets the redo stack. Loading or saving a trip resets both the undo and the redo stacks.

Note that changes which do *not* affect the geometry are *not* automatically saved.
So modifications to say route start time or route color are not saved unless the geometry is affected.
While this may seem like a somewhat arbitrary distinction, undoing state with no immediately visible 
outcome didn't seem user friendly.

The undo / redo buttons are only visible when in editing mode.
