### Atlantic Rally for Cruisers

About 200 boats participate annually in the <a href="https://www.worldcruising.com/arc/" target="_blank"> Atlantic Rally for Cruisers (ARC).</a>.
The 2700 nMi rally follows the trade winds from [Las Palmas de Gran Canaria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Las_Palmas_de_Gran_Canaria) to [Rodney Bay, Saint Lucia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rodney_Bay), in the Caribbean.

These trips are optimized to show wind direction and strength along the route.  To understand how to read the 
windrose, see this [post](/trip/trip-columbus).
