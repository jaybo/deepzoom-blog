DeepZoom Links are created using the **clipboard copy** button, above.  Links now  include relevant state values such as date and time, playing/paused status, duration, location, zoom, layers, weather and opacities, and tide station, buoy, or marker selected. 
This makes it easy to share conditions at a particular location. Note that routes, tracks, and private markers are NOT included in the link. 
To share these items, you'll need to continue sharing a trip.

The goal here is to make sharing easier without the necessity of logging in, creating, naming, and saving a trip.  In summary, there are now three methods of launching DeepZoom while specifying initial content:

| Type | sample url | contents | where is it? |
| ---- | ---------- | -------  | -------------|
|**Trip**| https://www.deepzoom.com/trip/dwmfjt2f | all routes, tracks, and private markers | Trips.Share |
|**Marker**| https://www.deepzoom.com/marker/GNIS1512376/0/ | just select a marker | Copy Link on info tab dropdown |
|**Clipboard** | https://www.deepzoom.com/s/20250101-Gori7e5ZYP | most state except routes, tracks, and public markers | Clipboard copy button |
